abstract = {Abstract A realistic numerical three-dimensional (3D) model was constructed to study CO2 transport inside a birch leaf. The model included chloroplasts, palisade and spongy mesophyll cells, airspaces, stomatal opening and the leaf boundary layer. Diffusion equations for CO2 were solved for liquid(mesophyll) and gaseous(air) phases. Simulations were made in typical ambient field conditions varying stomatal opening, photosynthetic capacity and temperature. Doubled ambient CO2 concentration was also considered. Changes in variables caused non-linear effects in the total flux, especially when compared with the results of double CO2 concentration. The reduction in stomatal opening size had a smaller effect on the total flux in doubled concentrations than ambient CO2. The reduced photosynthetic capacity had a similar effect on the flux in both cases. The palisade and spongy mesophyll cells had unequal roles mainly due to the light absorption profile. Results from the 3D simulation were also compared to the classical one-dimensional resistance approach. Liquid and gas phase resistances were estimated and found strongly variable according to changes in temperature and degree of stomatal opening. For the birch leaves modelled, intercellular airspace resistance was small (2\% of the total resistance in saturating irradiance conditions at 25 °C at stomatal opening diameter of 4 µm) whereas the liquid phase resistance was significant (23\% for mesophyll and chloroplasts in the same ‘base case’). The absorption of CO2 into water at cell surfaces caused additional (strongly temperature dependent) resistance which accounted for 36\% of the total resistance in the base case.},

abstract = {Plants provide an excellent system to study CO2 diffusion because, under light saturated conditions, photosynthesis is limited by CO2 availability. Recent findings indicate that CO2 diffusion in leaves can be variable in a short time range. Mesophyll CO2 conductance could change independently from stomata movement or CO2 fixing reactions and it was suggested that, beside others, the membranes are mesophyll CO2 conductance limiting components. Specific aquaporins as membrane intrinsic pore proteins are considered to have a function in the modification of membrane CO2 conductivity. Because of conflicting data, the mechanism of membrane CO2 diffusion in plants and animals is a matter of a controversy vivid debate in the scientific community. On one hand, data from biophysics are in favor of CO2 diffusion limiting mechanisms completely independent from membrane structure and membrane components. On the other, there is increasing evidence from physiology that a change in membrane composition has an effect on CO2 diffusion.}

abstract = {In boundary representation, a geometric object is represented by the union of a ‘topological’ model, which describes the topology of the modelled object, and an ‘embedding’ model, which describes the embedding of the object, for instance in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In recent years, numerous topological models have been developed for boundary representation, and there have been important developments with respect to dimension and orientability. In the main, two types of topological models can be distinguished. ‘Incidence graphs’ are graphs or hypergraphs, where the nodes generally represent the cells of the modelled subdivision (vertex, edge, face, etc.), and the edges represent the adjacency and incidence relations between these cells. ‘Ordered’ models use a single type of basic element (more or less explicitly defined), on which ‘element functions’ act; the cells of the modelled subdivision are implicitly defined in this type of model. In this paper some of the most representative ordered topological models are compared using the concepts of the n-dimensional generalized map and the n-dimensional map. The main result is that ordered topological models are (roughly speaking) equivalent with respect to the class of objects which can be modelled (i.e. with respect to dimension and orientability).}
