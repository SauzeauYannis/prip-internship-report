\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude, this internship was a great opportunity to learn about the research process 
and to get a taste of what it is like to work in a research group. I have learned a lot 
about the research process and about the different tools that are used in. I have also 
learned a lot about research that are done in the field of computer vision, pattern 
recognition, and some other areas that are interesting to me. During this internship,
I wrote my first scientific paper for a workshop organized by the Austrian Association 
for Pattern Recognition (OAGM) \cite{OAGM}. Currently, I don't know yet if the paper
is accepted or not, but I prepared a poster for the workshop if the paper is accepted.
It was a very good experience to write a paper and a poster, and I hope I could
participate to the workshop if the paper is accepted.
