This internship report contains the results of 3 months of internship in 
the Pattern Recognition and Image Processing Group at the Vienna University of 
Technology. After an introduction presenting the laboratory, the research
project and a technical overview of the internship, we present the work done 
and the results obtained. A big part of the report is focus on the main
research topic, which is the modelling of the diffusion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ in 
the leaf cells. The future work will be focused on the continuation of the
research and on the absorption of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ by the leaf cells in order
to achieve the objective of the project. A conclusion is given on the
diffusion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ in the leaf cells with a paper written for a
workshop on the topic.
