\vspace{1.0in}

I'm extremely grateful to Walter G. Kropatsch for giving me the opportunity to make this
internship in the PRIP laboratory. I would also like to thank him for his passion for 
research and the way he has transmitted it. I'd like to express my deepest thanks to
Jiří Hladůvka who was my supervisor during the internship. He gave me a lot of good
advice and helped me to understand the research process. I would also like to thank
Majid Banaeyan and Darshan Batavia for their help and support during the internship.
I would like to pay my special regards to Samuel Peltier for giving me the contact
of the PRIP laboratory. I must also thank Thierry Urruty my supervisor in France.
Finally, I would like to thank all the people I have met during the internship and
the friends I have made in Vienna.
