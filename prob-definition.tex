The technical objective of the internship was to contribute to an interdisciplinary
research project bridging plant biology, 3D imaging, and computer science. The 
objective of this project is to make a collaboration between the plant biologists
and the computer scientists in order to understand better the biological processes
involved in the photosynthesis of the plant. With this understanding, we will be able 
to reduce the amount of water we give to the plant for the growing process.
